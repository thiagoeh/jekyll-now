Do you know the difference between and the purpose of `~/.bash_profile`, `~/.bashrc`, `~/.profile`, `/etc/profile`, and wichever another bash startup script that comes in your Linux distro?

I didn't, and the whole thing looked confusing to me.
If I want to create some aliases and customize my prompt, in which of these file do I put the commands?


## Bonus

`~/.bash_logout`
